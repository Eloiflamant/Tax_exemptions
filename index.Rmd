# **Review of tax exemption measures in European Union countries
**

The purpose of this review is to take stock of the tax exemptions proposed by European countries in their current tax legislation. It follows the [review](http://www.oecd.org/fr/ctp/taxation-and-employment-9789264120808-en.htm) developed by the OECD in 2011. 

A difference has been made between the exemptions set up specifically to attract skilled workers and those aimed at bringing in the wealthiest taxpayers, in order to benefit from their tax resources and their level of consumption. 

Tax measures that are advantageous in nature but that do not discriminate against a foreign population were not mentioned. However, it should be remembered that a favourable tax system remains an important reason for transferring one's tax residence in Europe.
