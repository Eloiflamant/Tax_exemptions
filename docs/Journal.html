<h1 class="title toc-ignore"><strong>Fiscal exemptions for high-skilled foreign workers</strong></h1>

</div>


<p>Several tax exemptions have been set up in order to attract high-skilled workers. These exemptions are often temporary measures, subject to income levels and eligibility requirements. Specific jobs are sometimes targeted, especially knowledge-based activities (profesors, researchers…).</p>
<p>There has been a clear acceleration of this type of measurement in recent years. Countries that have been rather reluctant to implement them so far (France, for example) have been forced to do so. <br> <br></p>
<div id="austria" class="section level1">

<h2><span style="color:blue"> The regime of impatriate workers </span> <br></h2>
<div id="exemptions-3" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Exemptions</em> <br></h3>
<p>The impatriate regime provides for income tax exemptions for persons domiciled for tax purposes outside France during the 5 calendar years preceding their employment in a company established in France (intra-group mobility or external recruitment). Exemptions are provided for in <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000037985788/">Article 155B of the CGI</a></p>
<p>There are also exemptions for expenses. There are three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>The operating costs falling under <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000038836748/2019-10-01">Article 81 of the CGI</a></li>
<li>Specific allowances for impatriates (additional cost of housing and tax equalization)</li>
<li>Other specific indemnities (impatriation bonus seen below, personal expenses, home improvement and household appliancesd expenses, automobile purchase expenses).</li>
</ul>
<p>Other exemptions are possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The impatriation bonus, which must be explicitly mentioned by the employer and whose amount withdrawn from the total remuneration must result in a reference remuneration (comparable to that of a tax resident in France with the same skills and the same job).</p></li>
<li><p>The share of the remuneration for activities carried out abroad</p></li>
<li><p>50% of income from movable capital from foreign sources (if coming from countries that have a convention with France in the context of the fight against tax fraud).</p></li>
<li><p>50% of certain intellectual or industrial property income from foreign sources (under the same conditions as before)</p></li>
<li><p>50% of gains on the disposal of securities and employee rights from foreign sources</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the employee can also deduct social security contributions paid abroad :</p>
<ul>
<li>Paid to statutory pension schemes of the Social Security in their home country (8 years)</li>
<li>Paid into supplementary pension schemes (up to 5% of the URSSAF ceiling)</li>
<li>Paid into professional supplementary pension schemes (8% of annual remuneration up to 8 times the URSSAF ceiling).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Limitations</em></h3>
<p>There is a cap on certain exemptions with a choice :</p>
<ul>
<li>An overall cap at 50% of the total remuneration: impatriation bonus + part of the remuneration for activities carried out abroad</li>
<li>A cap on compensation for activities carried out abroad at 20% of total compensation</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="duration-3" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Duration</em></h3>
<p>The exemptions last until the end of the eighth calendar year since the 2017 Finance Act (fifth year for the previous period). An employee can therefore benefit from them for 9 years if he takes up his duties on January 1st of the year. The plan ends automatically if the employee leaves the company before the end of the term but not if he changes functions. <br/> <br/></p>

<p>Both allowances are deductible from income tax :</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional cost of housing in relation to the country of origin</li>
<li>Tax equalization</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional costs must be justified.</p>
<p>Conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the employee must not have been domiciled for tax purposes in France during the five calendar years prior to his or her arrival in France;</p></li>
<li><p>and the headquarters or logistics center must opt to subject these two allowances to a tax calculated at the standard corporate tax rate and related contributions in lieu of income tax on behalf of the employee.</p></li>

<p>Some countries (France, United Kingdom, Egypt, Morocco, Korea, Japan) benefit from a special agreement with Finland that allows their researchers not to pay income tax on Finnish territory even if their stay lasts more than 6 months and up to two years (5 years for South Korea). The benefit disappears if the researcher stays longer than two years, with the exception of France (the regime is retained for the first two years).</p>
